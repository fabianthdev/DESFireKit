# DESFireKit

This package has been purpose-built to provide the functions necessary for my [MensaCard iOS app](https://github.com/fabianthdev/mensacard-ios) to connect to and read data from the DESFire v1 NFC cards most universities use for their mensa card payment systems.

While I built this package with more features than necessary and with extensibility in mind, it is far from complete for uses other than with my app.
For reference I used the publicly available documentation for the DESFire v1 protocol.

If you want to use this package and require more features than currently implemented, feel free to open a PR.
